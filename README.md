# CVE-2016-6366

Public repository for improvements to the EXTRABACON exploit, written by the Equation Group (NSA) and leaked by the Shadow Brokers.

There is improved shellcode, a LINA offset finder script, a Metasploit module, and extrabacon-2.0.

We are adding patches for most versions of 8.x and 9.x in the near future after we test all versions on real hardware.

This is using improved shellcode, has less stages than the Equation Group version making it more reliable. This makes the SNMP payload packet ~150 less bytes. Also, the leaked version only supports 8.x, we have it working on 9.x versions.

### Supported Versions (so far)

8.2(3)
8.3(1)
8.4(3)

9.0(1)
9.1(1)4
9.2(2)8
9.2(3)
